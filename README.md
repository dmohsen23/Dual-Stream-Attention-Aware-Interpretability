# Dual-Stream-Attention-Aware-Interpretability
_A deep learning framework for interpretable diagnosis of distal myopathy via dual-stream attention-aware fusion._

---

## 📝 Overview

**Distal myopathies** are genetically heterogeneous muscle disorders characterized by specific myofiber alterations.  
This repository implements a **Dual-Stream Attention-Aware Fusion** model that:  
- Fuses **global** (ResNet50) + **local** (BagNet33) contextual information
- Uses the **Attention Gate** mechanism to efficiently fuse global and local contextual information.
- Generates saliency maps for interpretability  
- Evaluates interpretability using functionally grounded approaches: coherence score and incremental deletion.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **High Accuracy** on BUSI & Distal Myopathy datasets  
- 🧠 **Attention-Aware Fusion** for improved interpretability
- 📊 **Functionally Grounded Metrics**: Sanity check, incremental deletion, coherence score
